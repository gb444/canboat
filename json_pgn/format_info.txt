The files are stored in valid JSON.

The defines.json file stores all of the #defines from pgn.h as a dictionary.
 Some of those which were strung together text in the format: ",1=...,2=..." have 
 been reformatted as dictionary look up of the numbers.
 
The pgns.json file stores all the pgns from pgnList (pgn.h).
Pgns look as such:
{ "dsc": description string,
"pgn": pgn number,
"known": known boolean (Are we pretty sure we've got all fields with correct definitions?),
"size": size number ((Minimal) size of this PGN. Helps to determine fast/single frame and initial malloc)
"reptFld": repeatingFields number(How many fields at the end repeat until the PGN is exhausted?)
"fldLst": fieldList[] array of type Field
}

Fields look as such:
{"name":name string,
"size":size number(bits) or string "1B2b" = 1 byte and 2 bits,
"res": resolution number(float or special),
"sign": hasSign boolean,
"units": units string,
"dsc":description string,
"ofst": offset number
}
